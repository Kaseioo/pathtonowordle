            <p>
              A Yellow Guess, also indicated by an approximately equal â‰… symbol, means that a Sinner's information is within a certain range of the daily Sinner's information. This can mean that their heights are similar, or their MBCC Code is close. Do note that the ranges are bigger for Code!
            </p>
            {/* <br />
            <p>
              For example, Bianca's height is 166 centimeters. If our Daily Sinner was Eleven, you would get a yellow square as their height is close.
            </p> */}

            <summary>Arrows (click to expand)</summary>
            <p>
              A single arrow (â†‘) means that your guess is considerably distant from the actual Sinner's information. Double (â†‘â†‘) arrows means that you are very, very far from the actual value. An arrow pointing up (â†‘) means that the daily Sinner's value is higher, while one pointing down (â†“) means that it is lower. Do note that the ranges are a lot bigger for Code!
